# Solo Founder Agents

> A 24/7 AI assistant system for solo founders. Operates product-specific agents using Claude Code.

Running a company alone doesn't mean working alone. Solo Founder Agents gives you a full virtual team — 23 specialized AI agents organized into 4 teams — that operates around the clock via your favorite messenger, scheduled routines, and CLI tools. Just talk to it like you'd talk to a co-founder, and the right specialist picks up.

**Supports:** Discord | Slack | Telegram — choose one or multiple during setup.

---

## What This Is

A self-hosted AI operations system that turns Claude Code into a **team of domain experts** for your startup. Instead of one generic chatbot, you get:

- A **Strategy team** that validates PMF hypotheses, scopes features, and analyzes data
- A **Growth team** that writes copy, plans GTM, and runs paid campaigns
- An **Experience team** that conducts user research, designs UX flows, and builds UI systems
- An **Engineering team** that architects systems, writes code, manages infra, and collects data

Each agent carries 200+ lines of domain-specific expertise — not generic instructions, but structured frameworks, quality checklists, and handoff protocols that mirror how real teams operate.

---

## Why This Exists

Solo founders face a structural disadvantage: every decision — strategy, design, marketing, engineering — falls on one person. AI can help, but a single chat thread doesn't scale. You end up re-explaining context, losing decisions, and doing shallow work across too many domains.

This system solves that by giving each domain its own specialist agent, persistent memory, and structured workflows — so you can think at the strategic level while your agents handle the execution depth.

---

## Key Features

### 23 Agents, 4 Teams, 1 Command

Send a message in your messenger. The system analyzes your intent across 60+ keywords and routes it to the right specialist. No manual selection needed.

```
You: "Analyze our signup funnel drop-off"
→ Routes to Data Analyst (Strategy team)

You: "Write a launch announcement for Product Hunt"
→ Routes to Content Writer (Growth team)
```

### Multi-Platform Messenger Support

Pick the platform that fits your workflow — or run multiple simultaneously:

| Platform | Best For | Key Advantage |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Discord** | Channel-based teams | Auto-creates channels, rich category organization |
| **Slack** | Workspace integration | Socket Mode, native workspace feel |
| **Telegram** | Lightweight / mobile | Simple setup, works anywhere |

Set `MESSENGER=discord`, `MESSENGER=slack`, or `MESSENGER=discord,slack` for multi-platform.

### 3-Layer Context Isolation

The system prevents context bleeding across products and projects:

```
Layer 0: Universal     → Owner profile, principles, voice (shared everywhere)
Layer 1: Product       → Briefs, memory, signals (per-product)
Layer 2: Project       → Agents, experiments, status (per-project)
```

Each product gets its own workspace. Agents working on Product A never see Product B's data.

### Persistent Memory That Compounds

Routines run on schedule, extract structured data, and append to JSONL memory files. Over time, your agents build a growing knowledge base of signals, experiments, and decisions — so every interaction gets smarter.

### Multi-Session Team Orchestration

For complex projects (PMF validation, feature launches, rebranding), the Orchestrator breaks work into phases and coordinates multiple team sessions running in parallel:

```
Phase 1: Research    → User Researcher + Desk Researcher + Idea Refiner (parallel)
Phase 2: Planning    → PMF Planner + Feature Planner
Phase 3: Design      → UX Designer → UI Designer (sequential)
Phase 4: Build       → Architect → Frontend + Backend (parallel)
```

Agents hand off context to each other via a structured **Handoff Protocol** — summary, artifacts, key decisions, open questions — so nothing gets lost between stages.

### 24/7 Automated Routines

Five scheduled routines run daily without intervention:

| Time | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| 06:00 | Morning Brief — priorities and blockers for the day |
| 12:00 | Signal Scan — market signals, competitor moves, trends |
| 16:00 | Experiment Check — status of running experiments |
| 22:00 | Daily Log — decisions made, lessons learned |
| Sun 20:00 | Weekly Review — full week retrospective |

Results are posted to your messenger channels and auto-saved to memory.

### One-Command Install (npm)

```bash
npm install -g solo-founder-agents
solo-agents init
```

The wizard configures your owner profile, registers your products, generates all directory structures, initializes memory files, and gets you operational. OpenClaw-style `update` and `doctor` commands built in.

## Installation

### 1. Install
```bash
npm install -g solo-founder-agents
```

### 2. Initialize Workspace
```bash
mkdir my-workspace && cd my-workspace
solo-agents init
```

The setup wizard handles:
- Environment check (Node.js, Docker, git, Claude Code)
- Copies agent definitions, routines, templates to your workspace
- Messenger platform selection (Discord / Slack / Telegram / multi-platform)
- Token configuration with guided instructions
- Product/organization registration (multiple supported)
- Auto-generates product directories + memory + messenger config

### 3. Verify
```bash
solo-agents doctor
```

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
solo-agents init          # Setup wizard
solo-agents bot           # Start messenger bot
solo-agents schedule      # Start automated scheduler
solo-agents status        # Show project dashboard
solo-agents update        # Check for updates and self-update
solo-agents doctor        # Check environment and diagnose issues
solo-agents run-routine   # Run a routine manually
```

### Send Commands via Messenger

Send a message in the command channel (`#owner-command` on Discord/Slack, or direct message on Telegram). Keywords are analyzed to auto-route to the appropriate agent.

```
You: Draft landing page copy
Bot: [product-name (content-writer)] ...
```

60+ keywords → 23 agents auto-matched. Falls back to general mode if no keyword match.

### Run Routines Manually
```bash
solo-agents run-routine                    # Interactive selection
solo-agents run-routine signal-scan        # Run specific routine
solo-agents run-routine --all              # Run all routines
```

### Work Directly in a Project Directory
```bash
cd ~/repos/my-product/projects/pmf-validation
claude
# CLAUDE.md auto-loads with isolated context
```

## Core Concept: Per-Product Isolation

When you register multiple products, each gets its own isolated workspace.

```
~/repos/
├── product-a/           ← Product A workspace
│   ├── CLAUDE.md        ← Auto-generated (Product A context)
│   ├── product/         ← Brief, weekly status
│   ├── memory/          ← Hypotheses, experiments, decisions, signals
│   │   └── routine-logs/ ← Routine execution logs
│   └── projects/        ← Per-project isolation
│       └── pmf-validation/
│           ├── CLAUDE.md
│           └── ...
├── product-b/           ← Product B workspace
│   └── ...
└── product-c/
    └── ...
```

Each product's AI agents can **only see that product's context**. Other product data is walled off.

## Automated Routine Schedule

| Time | Routine | Report Channel | Memory Storage |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| 06:00 daily | Morning Brief | `#daily-brief` | - |
| 12:00 daily | Signal Scan | `#signals` | `signals.jsonl` |
| 16:00 daily | Experiment Check | `#experiments` | `experiments.jsonl` |
| 22:00 daily | Daily Log | `#daily-brief` | `decisions.jsonl` |
| Sun 20:00 | Weekly Review | `#weekly-review` | `decisions.jsonl` |

- JSON blocks in routine results are auto-extracted and appended to JSONL memory
- All routine logs are always saved to `memory/routine-logs/`

## FAQ

**Q: How do I authenticate Claude Code?**
A: Subscribe to Claude Code Max plan, then run `claude login` in your terminal.

**Q: How do I switch messenger platforms?**
A: Change `MESSENGER=slack` (or `telegram`, or `discord,slack`) in `.env` and restart the bot.

**Q: How do I use multiple messengers simultaneously?**
A: Set `MESSENGER=discord,slack` in `.env`. The bot and scheduler will connect to both platforms.

**Q: How do I add a product later?**
A: Re-run `solo-agents init`. Existing settings are preserved; only the new product is added.

**Q: How do I update to the latest version?**
A: Run `solo-agents update` — it checks npm for the latest version and offers to update.

**Q: What if agent routing is wrong?**
A: Edit the keyword-agent mapping in `src/bot/agent-router.ts` in the package source, or raise an issue.
